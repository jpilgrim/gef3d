/**

 * We use arbitrary texture sizes for performance reasons, 
 * this only works on machines with OpenGL version 2 or later.
 * Some video cards can do it with D3D and some OpenGL 2.0 cards canÂ´t.
 * In the first group are nVidia serie 6 and up and in second are 
 * ATI Radeon series 200 and 300.
